# javascript and Class & Objects
but js is prototype-based langauge

What is a prototype-based language?

A prototype-based language is a programming language where objects can inherit directly from other objects instead of classes.

In class-based languages (like Java, C++), objects are instances of classes.

# parts of OOPs

--Object Literals
--constructor function
--prototype
--classes
--instances(new,this)

# pillars
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism



# Main BatChi 

1. [constructor_function]: it is a normal function use to create object instance.
2. [prototype]: it is a object that has all important properties and method defined in constructor function.
3. [new]: new is operator that use to make the object and give the prototype of the constructor function.
4. [this]: this is operator that use to give the current context of object that calling to function.
   ## It refers to the instance itself, not the prototype.

# this = current object jiske andar data store hota hai.
# prototype = shared object jisme methods/properties rakhe jaate hain jo sab objects use kar sakte hain.
